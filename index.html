I didn't stop with the web, I went beyond with most popular JavaScript framework called Vue.js . I also know about deployment server and security. I can give you 100% web solution.

                They didn't offer me a job. But I made my self as a remote web developer. I made their website and showed it to them. They liked it and uploaded the content. It was fun working at Programming Hero.
